        Microservices have been at the center of modern backend architecture
        discussions for yearsâ€”and for good reason. When implemented properly,
        microservices allow teams to{" "}
        <strong>isolate business domains into independent services</strong>,
        unlocking major benefits:
      </p>

      <h2>ðŸš€ Benefits of Microservices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Faster deployments</strong> - Smaller, independently deployed
          services reduce build and test times in CI/CD pipelines, helping code
          reach QA or production faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technology flexibility</strong> - Services can be written in
          any language or framework as long as they communicate over common
          protocols (e.g. HTTP, gRPC, or messaging queues).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easier refactoring</strong> - Services that are small and
          focused are easier to rewrite or optimize with lower risk and effort.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Independent scaling</strong> - High-traffic services can be
          scaled separately, either via horizontal autoscaling or using
          serverless compute for better cost-efficiency.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Challenge: Migrating from a Monolith</h2>
      <p>
        For teams with an existing monolithic application, moving to a
        microservice architecture isn't easy. Why?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Domain boundaries are often blurry or nonexistent.</li>
        <li>Database access is embedded directly in business logic.</li>
        <li>Logic is tightly coupled across different parts of the system.</li>
        <li>There's no clear separation of concerns or layering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Without careful preparation, attempting to extract microservices from a
        traditional monolith can result in brittle systems, duplicated logic,
        and regression-prone deployments.
      </p>

      <h2> The Bridge: Building a Modular Monolith First</h2>
      <p>
        Before jumping into microservices, many engineering teams now adopt a{" "}
        <strong>modular monolith</strong> architecture. This is a single
        deployable application, but internally structured into{" "}
        <strong>distinct, encapsulated domains</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it as{" "}
        <em>designing microservices without deploying them separatelyâ€”yet</em>.
      </p>

      <h3> What is a Modular Monolith?</h3>
      <p>A modular monolith:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Enforces <strong>clear domain boundaries</strong> using folder
          structure and module organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prevents direct cross-domain access by using{" "}
          <strong>interfaces or adapters</strong> instead of direct imports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separates concerns into <strong>layers</strong>: data access,
          services, APIs/controllers, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepares the system for future extraction into microservices with
          minimal rework.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Example: A Social Media App</h3>
      <p>In a social media app, common domains might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users</li>
        <li>Posts</li>
        <li>Chats</li>
        <li>Notifications</li>
        <li>Ads</li>
        <li>Search</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each domain lives in its own module or folder, with all related logic,
        models, and services encapsulated within. Communication between domains
        happens only through <strong>interfaces</strong>â€”not direct imports or
        tight coupling.
      </p>

      <h3> Interfaces Enable Seamless Future Transitions</h3>
      <p>
        Let's say a user comments on a post, and that event should trigger a
        notification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a tightly coupled monolith, the <code>Posts</code> service might call
        a <code>Notifications</code> method directly. In a modular monolith, it
        would call an <strong>interface</strong>, like{" "}
        <code>INotificationService.publishCommentNotification()</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, this interface may be implemented with a simple function call.
        Tomorrow? That implementation could send an HTTP request to a separate
        Notifications microserviceâ€”or publish a message to a queueâ€”without
        changing a single line in the <code>Posts</code> domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        âœ… This decoupling allows you to <strong>gradually evolve</strong> into
        a microservice architecture at your own pace.
      </p>

      <h2> Horizontal Layering Enables Seamless Refactors</h2>
      <p>
        Clean <strong>horizontal layering</strong> of your appâ€”e.g., separating
        controllers, service logic, and data accessâ€”makes the transition even
        smoother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider your data access logic. Instead of writing raw database queries
        directly in your services, you abstract them behind{" "}
        <strong>repository interfaces</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>This way, when a domain is extracted into a microservice, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Swap the data layer to make <strong>HTTP or RPC requests</strong>{" "}
          instead of DB calls
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave the <strong>service logic untouched</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reuse the same unit tests and interfaces with little or no changes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This technique allows you to gradually change "how" data is fetched
        without affecting "what" the logic does.
      </p>

      <h2> Summary (tl;dr) </h2>
      <p>
        Jumping straight from a traditional monolith to microservices can be
        risky and complex. But building a modular monolith first allows you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforce clear domain boundaries</li>
        <li>Create independently testable modules</li>
        <li>Decouple business logic from infrastructure</li>
        <li>
          Delay the cost of distributed systems until you actually need them
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When the time is right to break a domain into its own service, the
        groundwork is already in place. You simply{" "}
        <strong>swap the implementation</strong>, not the interface.
      </p>
